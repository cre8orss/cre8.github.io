# Commissioned Website for Gamma Nu Eta

Lab 4 of Web Systems Development

The website is divided into 3 pages, home page, events/activities page, and the tuturing form page.
The files use divs, navs, and buttons for most of the functionality and display of data. Most of the
information we used in our site was cited from an article we found on the internet about the fraternity.
The CSS is mostly done using Bootstrap 5 and some minor CSS in our style.css file. Our JSON/AJAX requirement 
is completed by storing repetivtive data in our data.json file and using AJAX to output it into a
collapse object created using Bootstrap. This is incoporated into our home page and events/activities
pages. On top of that, we have a off canvas object which when the button to activate it is clicked,
it opens a sidebar which houses social media and contact links. Some difficulties we ran into was with
reading the JSON using AJAX which was due to referencing our script.js file before our jQuery reference.
We also ran into some issues with posititioning the images because even if the code was exactly the same,
the positioning would be slightly off on another page which was something that would happen randomly and
couldn't be consistently recreated.
